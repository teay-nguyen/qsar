predict IC50 or binding affinity for drug-like molecules against a target 

datasets: 
- ChEMBL
- BindingDB

combine moleceular fingerprints with regression models 
try multitask learning to predict multiple targets simultaneously

Scale up:
- try graph neural networks (here)
- try descriptors from mordred

-------------------------------

generate molecules with desired properties (e.g. high binding affinity, low toxicity) 

use generative models (variational autoencoders, diffusion models, reinforcement learning) 
train reward functions from qsar or dft-calculated properties 

generation approach:
- String-based models: RNN or Transformer on SMILES
- Graph-based models = GNN-based generators (e.g., GraphAF, JT-VAE)

1) pretrain good representations

molecules:
- Self-supervised GNN (GraphMVP / MolCLR-style): masked-atom + contrastive views (SMILES↔graph↔3D conformer).
- 3D equivariant encoder: SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant MPNN (e.g., SE(3)-Transformer/MACE)
  on ETKDG conformers for 3D-aware embeddings

proteins:
- Pocket encoder (graph of pocket residues or atom cloud) with E(3)-equivariant layers
  + SES/shape features; optionally diffusion-predicted pocket conformers.
- Output: robust molecular and pocket embeddings used by generators, predictors, and BO.

2) generators
Equivariant diffusion for ligand coordinates conditioned on pocket (Pocket2Mol/TargetDiff-style):
generates atoms, types, bonds, and 3D coordinates consistent with the pocket.

Optional pose-guided refinement using DiffDock-like score or an SE(3) score network.

3) Property models with calibrated uncertainty

Multitask predictors (QSAR/ADMET/tox): D-MPNN or equivariant nets; heteroscedastic heads +
deep ensembles → aleatoric + epistemic uncertainty.

train a cheap base (e.g., GFN2-xTB/semi-empirical or fast docking) then a Δ-model
to correct toward expensive labels (DFT B3LYP/def2-TZVP or rigorous docking/MM-GBSA) on a sparse subset.

4) reward & constraints
define vector objectives per molecule m:

5) two optimizers in tandem
(i) RL on the generator
(ii) latent-space bayesian optimization
RL explores locally with policy gradients; BO performs global, sample-efficient jumps in latent space.
Keep both running in alternating rounds

6) Physics & structure feedback (for SBDD or higher fidelity)
Fast stage: DiffDock/GNINA scores + MMFF94 energy checks.
Mid stage: short OpenMM MD (NVT 100–200 ps) to reject unstable poses; compute simple MM/GBSA.
High stage (sparse): DFT single-points (Δ-learning targets) on top candidates; periodic re-fit of Δ-model.

7) Synthesis & patentability gate
Retrosynthesis (ASKCOS/AiZynthFinder/Retro*): route score, steps, building block availability → penalty in R.
Maintain a memory bank to avoid revisiting failed chemotypes.

8) active training loop
1. generate batch (RL+BO)
2. score (predictors → uncertainty; docking/physics).
3. Select informative Pareto-front compounds for expensive labels (DFT/docking/MD).
4. update models and uncertainty calibration; iterate.
