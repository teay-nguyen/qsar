predict IC50 or binding affinity for drug-like molecules against a target 

datasets: 
- ChEMBL
- BindingDB

combine moleceular fingerprints with regression models 
try multitask learning to predict multiple targets simultaneously

Scale up:
- try graph neural networks (here)
- try descriptors from mordred

-------------------------------

generate molecules with desired properties (e.g. high binding affinity, low toxicity) 

use generative models (variational autoencoders, diffusion models, reinforcement learning) 
train reward functions from qsar or dft-calculated properties 

generation approach:
- string-based models: RNN or Transformer on SMILES
- Graph-based models = GNN-based generators (e.g., GraphAF, JT-VAE)

workflow:
1. pretrain a generative model on large molecule set
2. define reward = QSAR model score + synthetic accessibility + drug-likeness.
3. optimize: RL loop: generator --> QSAR --> reward --> policy update

TODO:
- explore bioactivity data for target CHEMBL203 (Epidermal growth factor receptor erbB1)
